This list is by no means comprehensive.

* [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)'s [introduction](https://youtu.be/2_2ttm1GHs4) to the [Natural Language Processing course](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/teaching/CMSC_470/)
* [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/)'s [Statistical NLP](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/How%20to%20Do%20Things%20with%20Words.ipynb)
* [Natural Language Processing with Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning, 2012](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOFZnDyrlW3-nI7tMLtmiJZ)
* Probably all of the courses / resources in the [Stanford Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/teaching/)

### Conferences

* [Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP](https://insights-workshop.github.io/index): this is something everyone working in NLP should check out. Benefit from the insights others drew from negative findings, share yours so that others don't need to make the same mistake again.
* [ACL](https://2024.aclweb.org)

### Code

* [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp): A curated list of resources dedicated to Natural Language Processing
* [Caveats in spaCy: A case for overlapping annotations in spacy](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/spacy_caveats.ipynb)
* [A comparison of TextBlob and spaCy for NLP tasks in German](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/textblob_vs_spacy.ipynb)
* [NLP with elasticsearch: A demonstration of tokenization with elasticsearch analyzers](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/elasticsearch-nlp.ipynb)
