## About me

I received my PhD in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) where I was member of the Text Mining group. Now I work on AI and data driven products, mostly focused on applications in the medical and healthcare domain.

My main passion is in NLP, especially for the German language. I am also interested in Information Retrieval (IR) and sometimes I build Recommender Systems.

### Talks

* I gave an update of the talk on Large Language Models for Medical Language Processing at [IT Tage 2023](https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/index.html). Here's a [Take Away Post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damedic_chatgpt-nlp-ki-activity-7158049615135522818-CTE9). 
* I was invited to give a talk about Large Language Models and their application to medical data at the [data2health Summerschool](https://www.data2health.de/de/summerschool). I found the book [Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-23190-2) by my PhD advisor [Gerd Paa√ü](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerhard-paass-20061359/) incredibly helpful for that.
* I talked about NLP for medical data with focus on German data and medical controlling at the [ML Conference (online)](https://mlconference.ai/machine-learning-principles/natural-language-processing-for-medical-data/). [Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/natural-language-processing-for-medical-data), heavily [damedic](https://www.damedic.ai/en/) branded ;-)
* I gave a talk about entity linking for biomedical data at the [Hamburg Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hamburg-Data-Science-Meetup/), Hamburgs largest data event. [Here are the slides](https://www2.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/biomedical-entity-linking-introduction-approaches-challenges).
* I was invited to give a talk at my alma mater [Hochschule Koblenz](https://www.hs-koblenz.de/rac/index/) to tell the students (all aspiring data scientists, I hope) a bit about the life of a data scientist and my career path in general. As this was a bit informal, I chose the humorous avenue, so bear with me. [Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-career-path-in-data-science) (in German).  
* I have a thing for tested code. In an "automated-vs-print-statement" sense. [Here are some motivational slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-case-for-automated-tests) that unfortunately do not seem to get old.

### Resources

* I maintain a (somewhat opiniated) [list of resources](resources/index.md), covering blogs, newsletters and social events in the AI and tech ecosphere.
* [This page](_posts/2020-08-27-getting-into-nlp.md) is more focussed on NLP and contains a (hopefully growing) list of resources to get started in that domain.
* I love podcasts. Here's my heavily biased list of [aweswome-podcasts](https://github.com/aplz/awesome-podcasts).
* Last but not least, here are [some rather dusty notebooks on NLP](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks) (mostly spaCy and elasticsearch related).
