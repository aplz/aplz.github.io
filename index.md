## About me
I received my PhD in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) from the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) where I was member of the Text Mining group. Now I work on AI and data driven products, mostly focused on applications in the medical and healthcare domain.

My main passion is in NLP, especially for the German language. I am also interested in information retrieval (IR) and sometimes I build recommender systems.

### Talks
* I gave a talk about entity linking for biomedical data at the [Hamburg Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hamburg-Data-Science-Meetup/), Hamburgs largest data event. [Here are the slides](https://www2.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/biomedical-entity-linking-introduction-approaches-challenges).
* I was invited to give a talk at my alma mater [Hochschule Koblenz](https://www.hs-koblenz.de/rac/index/) to tell the students (all aspiring data scientists, I hope) a bit about the life of a data scientist and my career path in general. As this was a bit informal, I chose the humorous avenue, so bear with me. [Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-career-path-in-data-science) (in German).  
* I have a thing for tested code. In an "automated-vs-print-statement" sense. [Here are some motivational slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-case-for-automated-tests) that unfortunately do not seem to get old.
