## About me

I received my PhD in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) where I was member of the Text Mining group. Now I work on AI and data driven products, mostly focused on applications in the medical and healthcare domain.

My main passion is in NLP, especially for the German language, and Information Retrieval (IR). Sometimes I build Recommender Systems.

### Talks

* At [PyCon DE & PyData 2025](https://2025.pycon.de), I talked about Information Retrieval, how we can measure search engine effectiveness (please head over to [Daniel Tunkelang](https://dtunkelang.medium.com) for cited sources), and how I built a hybrid search for [Sendung mit der Maus](https://www.wdrmaus.de).  You can't find the demo in the [slides](https://de.slideshare.net/slideshow/information-retrieval-without-feeling-lucky-the-art-and-science-of-search/280267238) but the code will be up on github soon. I am also happy to chat so please reach out to me if you want to learn more. 
* On the ["Tag der Mathematik"](https://www.hs-koblenz.de/rac/aktuelles/regelmaessige-veranstaltungen/tag-der-mathematik) at [RheinAhrCampus Remagen](https://www.hs-koblenz.de/rac/index/), I spoke about how machine learning-based services shape our everyday lives and how I have contributed to such tools and products during the last years. The talk is intended to inspire more young people to study mathematics by showcasing the diversity of applications. Especially in the fields of AI and Data Science. [Slides](https://de.slideshare.net/slideshow/a-career-path-in-data-science-machine-learning-im-alltag-7481/272979387) are in German.
* I gave an update of the talk on [Large Language Models for Medical Language Processing](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/konnen-large-language-models-helfen-meinen-patienten-zu-verstehen-d1b1) at [IT Tage 2023](https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/index.html). Here's a [Take Away Post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damedic_chatgpt-nlp-ki-activity-7158049615135522818-CTE9). 
* I was invited to give a talk about Large Language Models and their application to medical data at the [data2health Summerschool](https://www.data2health.de/de/summerschool). I found the book [Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-23190-2) by my PhD advisor [Gerd Paa√ü](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerhard-paass-20061359/) incredibly helpful for that.
* I talked about NLP for medical data with focus on German data and medical controlling at the [ML Conference (online)](https://mlconference.ai/machine-learning-principles/natural-language-processing-for-medical-data/). [Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/natural-language-processing-for-medical-data), heavily [damedic](https://www.damedic.ai/en/) branded ;-)
* I gave a talk about entity linking for biomedical data at the [Hamburg Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hamburg-Data-Science-Meetup/), Hamburgs largest data event. [Here are the slides](https://www2.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/biomedical-entity-linking-introduction-approaches-challenges).
* I was invited to give a talk at my alma mater [Hochschule Koblenz](https://www.hs-koblenz.de/rac/index/) to tell the students (all aspiring data scientists, I hope) a bit about the life of a data scientist and my career path in general. As this was a bit informal, I chose the humorous avenue, so bear with me. [Here are the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-career-path-in-data-science) (in German).  
* I have a thing for tested code. In an "automated-vs-print-statement" sense. [Here are some motivational slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AnjaPilz/a-case-for-automated-tests) that unfortunately do not seem to get old.

### Resources

* I maintain a (somewhat opiniated) [list of resources](resources/index.md), covering blogs, newsletters and social events in the AI and tech ecosphere.
* [This page](_posts/2020-08-27-getting-into-nlp.md) is more focussed on NLP and contains a (hopefully growing) list of resources to get started in that domain.
* I love podcasts. Here's my heavily biased list of [awesome-podcasts](https://github.com/aplz/awesome-podcasts).
* Last but not least, here are [some rather dusty notebooks on NLP](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks) (mostly [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) related).
