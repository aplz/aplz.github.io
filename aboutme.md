title: About me
---

I received my PhD in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) from the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) where I was member of the Text Mining group. Now I work on AI and data driven products, mostly focused on applications in the medical and healthcare domain.

My main passion is in NLP but my interests also include information retrieval (IR) and sometimes I build recommender systems. 

### Natural language processing
* [Caveats in spaCy: A case for overlapping annotations in spacy](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/spacy_caveats.ipynb)
* [A comparison of TextBlob and spaCy for NLP tasks in German](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/textblob_vs_spacy.ipynb)
* [NLP with elasticsearch: A demonstration of tokenization with elasticsearch analyzers](https://github.com/aplz/nlp_notebooks/blob/master/elasticsearch-nlp.ipynb)

### Toy Projects. 
Not to be taken too seriously.
